# Project Overview

The project, titled "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms," is a part of the ALX Africa Intranet, focusing on C programming and search algorithms. It has a weight of 1 and runs from Oct 9, 2023, 4:00 AM, to Oct 15, 2023, 4:00 AM.

## Learning Objectives

Participants are expected to comprehend key concepts independently, covering search algorithms, particularly linear and binary search. Emphasis is placed on selecting the most suitable search algorithm for a given scenario.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Strict guidelines against plagiarism are outlined, requiring independent solution development by participants.

## Technical Requirements

- Coding standards, allowed editors, compilation settings, and style guidelines are provided.
- Restrictions on global variables, function usage, and file structure are specified.
- Documentation in the form of a README.md file and header files is mandatory.

## Tasks

1. **Task 0: Linear Search (Mandatory)**
   - Implement a function for linear search in an array of integers.
   - Include detailed requirements like function prototype, handling edge cases, and printing values during comparison.

2. **Task 1: Binary Search (Mandatory)**
   - Implement a function for binary search in a sorted array.
   - Specify requirements similar to Task 0.

3. **Tasks 2 to 5: Big O Notations (Mandatory)**
   - Provide time and space complexity (worst case) for linear and binary search algorithms.
   - Use separate files (2-O to 5-O) for each task.

4. **Task 6: Big O #4 (Mandatory)**
   - Analyze and determine the space complexity of a given function/algorithm related to memory allocation.

## QA Review and Checkpoints

Continuous quality assurance is emphasized, with a scoring system ensuring participants meet specific criteria.

## Additional Resources

Encouragement for participants to read or watch content related to search algorithms and space complexity.

## Advanced Tasks Unlock

Participants completing mandatory tasks are eligible to unlock nine advanced tasks.
